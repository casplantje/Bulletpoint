Bulletpoint
===========

Bulletpoint is or rather will be a presentation tool working with a markup language rather than wysiwyg.
The idea is inspired on Pinpoint(https://live.gnome.org/Pinpoint), but Pinpoint is buggy and rather limited in layout possibilities.

The target of bulletpoint is to design a markup language which makes it possible to nest text, pictures, etc in other objects, a bit like GTK layout.
To achieve this goal the decorator pattern will be important. This design pattern facilitates the nesting of the objects.
